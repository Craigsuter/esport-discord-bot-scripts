# esport-discord-bot-scripts
These are scripts / definition files you may find useful in creating bots specifically aimed at esports
They will help for giving users up to date data on the team you support / tournaments you are tracking!

I will be adding a 'main' file to this code area so that you can see how the main file needs to be formatted with examples of the code being used!

I will also include a step-by-step guide on setting up your own discord bot + free hosting
